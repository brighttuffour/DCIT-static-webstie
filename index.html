      The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020 there were 56 million cars manufactured worldwide,[101] down from 67 million the previous year.[102]

The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20 million in 2020), followed by Japan (7 million), then Germany, South Korea and India.[103] The largest market is China, followed by the USA.

Around the world there are about a billion cars on the road;[104] they burn over a trillion liters of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 EJ (nearly 300 terawatt-hours) of energy.[105] The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India.[15] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car
 have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[106][107] The sustainable transport movement focuses
  on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.
